My first program from 2009 for calculating basic geometric functions (in Czech language).
Completely simple mathematical calculations programmed in Visual Basic.
Stored here solely for archival and nostalgic purposes.

In this program, you simply enter values to calculate various geometric shapes listed below.
For better accuracy, you can select a specific shape from the menu on the left â€“ the relevant input fields will be highlighted depending on whether you're calculating area, perimeter, etc.
If you leave a required field empty, the program will notify you.
After the calculation, the formula used is also displayed.
The TGeometry program does not require installation.

Square: perimeter, area, diagonal, radius of the inscribed circle, radius of the circumscribed circle
Rectangle: perimeter, area, diagonal, radius of the circumscribed circle,
Triangle perimeter, area,
Trapezoid perimeter, area, median (midsegment)
Parallelogram: perimeter, area
Circle: circumference, area
