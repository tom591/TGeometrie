# 🧮 TGeometry v1 (2009)

**My first program from 2009 for calculating basic geometric functions (in Czech language).**  
Completely simple mathematical calculations programmed in Visual Basic.  
Stored here solely for archival and nostalgic purposes.

## 📦 About the Program

In this program, you simply enter values to calculate various geometric shapes listed below.  
For better accuracy, you can select a specific shape from the menu on the left –  
the relevant input fields will be highlighted depending on whether you're calculating area, perimeter, etc.  

If you leave a required field empty, the program will notify you.  
After the calculation, the formula used is also displayed.  
The TGeometry program does not require installation.
